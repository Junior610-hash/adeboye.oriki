    <div class="history">
    <p>Oriki is an oral poetic tradition of the Yoruba people of West Africa, consisting of praise poems used to honor individuals, families, and communities. The word Oríkì is derived from the Yoruba words Orí (head) and Kì (to praise, greet, or offer accolades).

   <h2>Defination</h2>

  <div class="history2">
<P>Oríkì is a form of verbal art that captures the history, accomplishments, and character of its subject. It is essentially a poetic eulogy that can be recited or chanted, often accompanied by the talking drum (gangan). Oríkì serves as a repository of knowledge that transmits a family or person's lineage and history from one generation to the next.
There are several types of Oríkì: 
<ul>
<li>•	Oríkì Orílẹ̀: For towns or settlements, describing their history and origins.</li>
<li>•	Oríkì Ìdílé: For family lineages, detailing their heritage.</li>
<li>•	Oríkì Ṣókí: Personal praise names given at birth, often based on the circumstances of the child's arrival.</li>
<li>•	Oríkì Ogbó: Praises for elders who have lived a virtuous life.</li>
<li>•	Oríkì for deities and animals: Praises for gods, goddesses, and animals. </li>
</ul>
</P>
  </div>

 <h3> Origins  </h3>

 <div class="history3">
<p>The precise historical beginning of Oríkì is unknown, but it is deeply embedded in the ancient traditions of the Yoruba people. Most Oríkì Orílẹ̀ (praise poems for towns) predate written records, with some estimated to have originated as far back as the 13th century. 
Oríkì developed as a core element of Yoruba oral literature and tradition, which was historically preserved and passed down by memory. 
•	Passed down orally: Traditionally, women were the primary transmitters of Oríkì within the family. New brides were expected to memorize the Oríkì of their husbands' lineages and would later add their own contributions.
•	Rooted in philosophy: The practice is tied to the Yoruba philosophical concept of "I am because you are," which emphasizes that an individual's identity is connected to their community and ancestry
   </ul>

<h4>How it started</h4>

  <div class="history4">
<ul>
Oríkì did not have a single starting point or creator but evolved as a dynamic, intergenerational art form over centuries. Its emergence is linked to the development of Yoruba social structures and the need to preserve history and identity before written language became common. 
The practice started as a way to:
<li>•	Commemorate achievements: Celebrate the achievements and character of a person, family, or community.</li>
<li>•	Record history: Serve as a verbal data bank, preserving the history and heritage of a lineage.</li>
<li>•	Inspire individuals: Evoke virtuous character traits, like bravery or perseverance, believed to be innate in a person's bloodline.</li>
<li>•	Calm emotions: Act as a psychological tool, with parents or family members chanting Oríkì to soothe a distressed child or family member.</li>
<li>•	Reinforce social bonds: Reciting Oríkì during ceremonies like weddings, naming ceremonies, and funerals strengthens social ties and fosters shared pride.</li> 
 is essential to human life because it provides a powerful link to ancestry, a strong sense of identity, and serves as an important psychological and social tool. For the Yoruba people, where it originated, oriki connects individuals with their community and history through verbal art that reinforces 
  </ul>
